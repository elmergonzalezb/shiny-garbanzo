Now it's just a bunch of python functions, which are downloading files from
put.io. **The development is in progress.**


What is this all about?
=======================
This tool [is|going to be] a tool for downloading and uploading files from the
cloud put.io. It can be very interesting for you if you don't like to click
several times on the download link if the folder contains a lot of small files,
so the sum of their size is more then the "zipable" limit. Or you have a very
slow internet-connection and you want to download you files in a special time
(e.g. when you don't use your internet-connection).
